# 🚀 FAANG-Track

This repository documents my structured and focused preparation journey toward securing a Software Engineering Internship or Full-Time role at top-tier tech companies (FAANG and beyond). It includes detailed progress tracking for coding problems, technical notes from system design and CS fundamentals, and a professional resume.

> Goal: Build depth and consistency across Data Structures, System Design, and Core CS to become FAANG-ready by Summer 2026.
