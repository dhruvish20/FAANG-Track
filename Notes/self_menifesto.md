# FAANG Prep Manifesto

## ðŸŽ¯ What do I want?
To get an SDE/AI internship or full-time offer from a top tech company like FAANG by Summer 2026.

## ðŸš§ Why haven't I succeeded yet?
- Lack of standout project
- Inconsistent DSA prep
- No network/referral strategy
- Resume isnâ€™t showing high impact

## ðŸ”¥ What will I do differently now?
- Code every day (DSA + project)
- Build and deploy a FAANG-level project
- Post weekly on LinkedIn and GitHub
- Reach out to 3 new people weekly
